# ZfrForum - Forum Module For Zend Framework 2

Master: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/zf-fr/ZfrForum.png)](http://secure.travis-ci.org/zf-fr/ZfrForum)

Note: ZfrForum is currently in development during our free-time. It's no where near to be usable, so any contributions,
advices... are really welcomed !

Just some notes about choice we are making in this forum : there are already PLENTY of open-source forums, even in
Zend Framework 1 (have a look at XenForo). But this is, to my knowing, the only forum module. However, we thought it
would be interesting to offer to people something different. For sure, this forum won't be for anyone.

We plan to make it a 100% client-side rendering forum, thus offering a complete REST API. We will provide an
AngularJS implementation out-of-the box, and taking advantage of ZF 2 AbstractRestController.
